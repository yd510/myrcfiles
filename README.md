#myrcfiles

This is the backup for my personal configs of vim and csh. Cause it could be copied and used in the enviroment without Internet, so all codes are uploaded as what they were. If this isn't right, pls let me know.

##Plugins included
*[Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) Plugins manager  
*[NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) Tree broswer  

And so on...
